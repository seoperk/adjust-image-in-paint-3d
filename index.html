                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Paint 3D remains a handy, free built-in tool on Windows for basic image editing in 2026. Whether you're preparing photos for social media, emails, websites, or printing, changing image dimensions (resizing) is one of the most common tasks. The process is straightforward using the Canvas settings, allowing precise control over width, height, and aspect ratio.</p>
                <p>This guide walks you through every step to resize images in Paint 3D while preserving quality as much as possible.

                <h2>Why Change Image Dimensions?</h2>
                <p>Resizing images serves many purposes in daily digital life:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduce file size for faster email attachments or quicker website loading</li>
                    <li>Fit platform requirements (e.g., 1080×1080 for Instagram posts, 1080×1920 for Stories)</li>
                    <li>Optimize for printing (ensure proper DPI and dimensions)</li>
                    <li>Make large photos manageable for sharing or storage</li>
                    <li>Crop focus while adjusting overall size</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Paint 3D handles shrinking well with minimal quality loss, but enlarging small images often results in blurriness—always work from high-resolution originals when possible.</p>

                <h2>Prerequisites & Opening Paint 3D</h2>
                <p>Ensure Paint 3D is installed (it comes pre-installed on Windows 10/11; if removed, sideload from trusted .appx sources or use the classic Paint alternative for simple 2D tasks).</p>
                <p>Quick ways to open your image:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Search "Paint 3D" in the Windows Start menu and launch it.</li>
                    <li>Right-click your image file → "Edit with Paint 3D" (fastest method).</li>
                    <li>In Paint 3D: Menu (top-left) → Open → browse to your file.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once open, your image appears on the canvas, ready for editing.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step: Resize Using Canvas</h2>
                <p>Follow these exact steps to change dimensions accurately:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Press <strong>Alt + C</strong> or click <strong>Canvas</strong> in the top toolbar to open the Canvas sidebar.</li>
                    <li>Check the box: <strong>Resize image with canvas</strong> (critical—this resizes the actual image pixels, not just adds white space).</li>
                    <li>Check <strong>Lock aspect ratio</strong> to prevent distortion (highly recommended for photos).</li>
                    <li>Switch the unit dropdown from <strong>Percentage</strong> to <strong>Pixels</strong> for precise control.</li>
                    <li>Enter your desired <strong>Width</strong> in pixels (Height auto-adjusts if aspect ratio is locked).</li>
                    <li>Click outside the sidebar or press Enter to apply.</li>
                    <li>Save: Menu → Save (Ctrl + S) or Save as (Ctrl + Shift + S) to create a new copy and preserve the original.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Done! Your image now has the new dimensions.</p>

            <section id="pixels-vs-percentage">
                <h2>Pixels vs Percentage Explained</h2>
                <p><strong>Pixels</strong>: Sets exact dimensions (e.g., 1200 × 800 px). Best for specific platform or print needs. Most accurate and commonly used.</p>
                <p><strong>Percentage</strong>: Scales relative to current size (e.g., 50% halves dimensions). Great for quick proportional reductions but less precise for target sizes.</p>
                <p>Pro tip: Always use Pixels for social media or web optimization—platforms specify pixel counts, not percentages.</p>

                <h2>Tips & Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                <p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shrink images instead of enlarging to maintain sharpness.</li>
                    <li>Keep original files—use Save as for resized versions.</li>
                    <li>For social media: 1080 px wide is a safe maximum for most platforms in 2026.</li>
                    <li>Undo mistakes with Ctrl + Z.</li>
                    <li>Use Ctrl + Shift + S to save copies without overwriting.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Common mistakes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Forgetting to check "Resize image with canvas" → only canvas expands, image stays same size.</li>
                    <li>Not locking aspect ratio → image distorts/stretches.</li>
                    <li>Enlarging low-res images → results in pixelation/blurriness.</li>
                    <li>Using Percentage when exact pixels are needed.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Alternatives if Needed</h2>
                <p>If Paint 3D doesn't meet your needs (e.g., batch resizing or advanced upscaling):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classic Microsoft Paint (updated in 2026 with layers) – simpler 2D resize via Ctrl + W.</li>
                    <li>Free tools: GIMP, Paint.NET, Photopea (browser-based).</li>
                    <li>AI upscalers: Topaz Gigapixel, Let's Enhance (better for enlarging).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Changing image dimensions in Paint 3D is quick, free, and effective for everyday resizing tasks in 2026. By using the Canvas tool with "Resize image with canvas" and aspect ratio locked, you can achieve clean, proportional results without complex software. Remember to resize downward for best quality and always keep backups of originals.
